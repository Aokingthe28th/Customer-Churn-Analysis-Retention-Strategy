Project Overview
This project presents an end-to-end customer churn analysis combining machine learning and business intelligence to understand, predict, and act on customer churn.
The work begins with data cleaning and exploratory analysis, progresses through predictive modeling, and concludes with an interactive Power BI dashboard designed to support data-driven business decisions.
Business Problem
Customer churn directly impacts revenue and long-term growth.
The objective of this project is to:
- Identify patterns and drivers of customer churn
- Predict customers at risk of leaving
- Translate analytical insights into actionable business strategies
Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)
- Machine Learning (Random Forest)
- Power BI (Power Query, DAX, interactive dashboards)
- Excel (data inspection and validation)
- GitHub (project documentation and versioning)
Key Insights
- High churn likelihood is associated with:
  - Low transaction frequency
  - Short customer tenure
- Retention actions should prioritize:
  - High-value customers showing early churn signals
  - Predictive models are most effective when paired with business context, not accuracy alone
 Business Impact
This project demonstrates how churn prediction can:
- Support proactive customer retention strategies
- Improve decision-making using interpretable models
- Bridge the gap between data science and business intelligence
