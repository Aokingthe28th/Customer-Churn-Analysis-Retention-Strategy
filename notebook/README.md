Analytical Approach
1. Data Preparation
   - Cleaned and validated customer records
d   - Handled missing values and inconsistent data
   - Encoded categorical features for machine learning
   - Ensured compatibility across Python and Power BI environments
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
 - Examined churn distribution and class imbalance
 - Analyzed customer behavior patterns such as:
   - Transaction frequency
   - Tenure
   - Service usage
 - Identified high-risk customer segments

3. Machine Learning Modeling
 - Built and evaluated churn prediction models
 - Focused on recall to minimize missed churners
 - Applied:
   - Cross-validation
   - Hyperparameter tuning
   - Confusion matrix and ROC-AUC evaluation

Key Insight:
Improving recall revealed trade-offs between accuracy and false positives, highlighting the importance of business-aligned evaluation metrics in imbalanced datasets.
